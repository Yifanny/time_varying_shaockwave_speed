Source code for Zhang, Yifan, Anastasios Kouvelas, and Michail A. Makridis. "A Time-varying Shockwave Speed Model for Trajectory Reconstruction using Lagrangian and Eulerian Observations." arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.00063 (2024).
time_varying_shockwave_speed_calibration.py is for estimating the time-varying shockwave speed.
traj_reconstruction.py is for reconstructing trajectories using estimated time-varying shochwave speed.

Here, we just upload one subset of datasets for illustration.
The corresponding estimation results are also uploaded.
